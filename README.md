# Advent of Code

The runner was adapted from
[this template](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust). It uses the
[aoc-cli](https://crates.io/crates/aoc-cli) crate, so first set up the session cookie
by following [this guide](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli/#session-cookie-).

Commands

- `cargo scaffold <day>`
- `cargo download <day>`
- `cargo solve <day>`
- `cargo all`
- `cargo time <day> [--all] [--store]`
- `cargo test`
