# Advent of Code


The runner was adapted from [this template](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust). It uses the [aoc-client](https://crates.io/crates/aoc-client) crate, which requires a session cookie to interact with Advent of Code. [This guide](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli/#session-cookie-) explains how to provide the session cookie.

The CLI helper can be invoked either with `cargo run -- --help` or
`target/debug/aoc --help`.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm in the process of moving old solutions to the new runner setup.
> New solutions are organized like `src/{year}/{day}.rs`.
