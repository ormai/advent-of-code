# Advent of Code

The runner was adapted from
[this template](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust). It uses the
[aoc-client](https://crates.io/crates/aoc-client) crate, so first set up the session cookie
by following [these instructions](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli/#session-cookie-).

The CLI helper can be invoked either with `cargo run -- --help` or
`target/debug/aoc --help`.
